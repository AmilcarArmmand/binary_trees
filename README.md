# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

---

## Learning Objectives :bulb:
Concepts covering in the this project:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Project tasks

---

### [0. New node](./0-binary_tree_node.c)
* Write a function that creates a binary tree node.

### [1. Insert node](./1-binary_tree_insert_left.c)
* A function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.

### [2. Insert right](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c)
* Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.

### [3. ](./3-binary_tree_delete.c)
* Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.

### [4. ](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c)
* Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf.

### [5. ](./5-binary_tree_is_root.c)
* Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.

### [6. ](./6-binary_tree_preorder.c)
* Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.

### [7. ](./7-binary_tree_inorder.c)
* Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.

### [8. ](./8-binary_tree_postorder.c)
* Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.

### [9. ](./9-binary_tree_height.c)
* Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.

### [10. ](./10-binary_tree_depth.c)
* Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

* Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree.

### [13. ](./13-binary_tree_nodes.c)
* Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.

### [14. ](./14-binary_tree_balance.c)
* Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree.

### [15. ](./15-binary_tree_is_full.c)
* Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full.

### [16. ](./16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c)
* Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.

### [17. ](./17-binary_tree_sibling.c)
* Write a function that finds the sibling of a node.

### [18. ](./18-binary_tree_uncle.c)
* Write a function that finds the uncle of a node.
